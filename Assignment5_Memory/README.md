# Logistics

For this assignment, you must login into the servers through `your_ccis_name@login.ccs.neu.edu` to complete the assignment. The reason is because the examples I will provide below are compiled strictly for our machines architecture, and this is where your submission will be graded.

## Introduction

This assignment is a two part assignment (Like some of our previous assignments), however I have broken it into two directories.

I recommend working on the cache simulator first, but neither part is dependent on the other.
