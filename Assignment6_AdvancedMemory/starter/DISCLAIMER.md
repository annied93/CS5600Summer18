This is a small note regarding my HW6 submissions.

The file mymalloc.c is the final file for submission for this homework.

The file passes the mini multithreading tests I wrote as well as the simpletest.c file. However, I still cannot get it to pass the t-test.c with multithreading. It has a segmentation fault during allocation.

Thanks,

Annie
