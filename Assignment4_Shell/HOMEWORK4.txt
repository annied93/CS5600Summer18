This file documents the error and bugs and limitation of my shell script.

1. The piping process in the script is buggy. It will execute the pipe correctly and 
produce the desired output, however, after the execution of the right command, it will
also exit out of the shell execution.
Essentially, when the commands were executed in the child process of the child of the
shell execution, it returns to the parent then terminate out of the grandparent after
execution is finished as well. I am not sure why it is doing this way but I will do my
best to debug before deadline.

2. The redirection is handled in the script, however it can only execute one redirection
per command. 
Essentially, it will execute: echo annie > annie.txt
but not:
cat < annie.txt > annie2.txt
I will atttempt to make the multiple redirection work - the issue has to do with my handling
of the resetting of the flag, so I will see about fixing it.

3. After I press Ctrl-C to terminate the file, it prints some giberrish from the script
before the entire shell is terminated. I'm not sure what's the reason but I modify this
after the given script and when I execute the part 2 code, it does the same thing.

4. I made the assumption that the & will always be at the end of the line, and execute the command
accordingly. This may cause error along the line for testing.

Thank you, and I hope this documentation helps with explaining the bugs and errors in my
shell.
