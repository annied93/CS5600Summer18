A circular queue is a linear data structure in which operations are performed in the order of ‘First In First Out’. ¬ A circular queue is different from a normal queue in the sense that the last position in the queue is connected to the first position. After the last position is filled, the next one to be filled will be the first position again, provided that the queue is not full.

Function-wise, the circular queue works the same way as a normal queue. When you add an item to the queue (‘enqueue’), the item will be added to the back of the queue at the next free position. When you remove an item (‘dequeue’), the item removed will be the one in the front position of the queue. The queue is bounded. 

The implementation of the circular queue is via a normal array, only that pointers will be used to keep track of the front of the queue, and the back of the queue where the next free slot is currently. Implementation is simple and scalable so it is a commonly used method in managing functions in OS, arranging the order of function for execution by an operating system, and the usage of circular queue by the OS would be more efficient. In addition, it is also use to model, simulate and analyse real-life queues, such as designing a traffic rotary and others.

The advantage of using a circular queue over a normal queue is that we can more effectively utilize the memory space allocated to the queue. This ensures that the spaces in the queue is used in an efficient way, compared to a traditional queue setup. A normal queue, when dequeuing, might create some empty spaces at the front end but the space is not reused for storage since items would only be added to the rear end of the queue. This results in wasting of memory blocks and may impact some functioning of the computer, especially when the queue memory allocation is a huge junk of the machine capacity.
